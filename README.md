## üß† Project Overview

- **Platform**: Siemens TIA Portal
- **CPU Used**: Siemens S7-313C-2 DP
- **Language**: LAD (Ladder Logic)
- **Blocks Used**: OB1 (Main), with multiple networks
- **Functions**:
  - Manual/Auto mode switching
  - State machine logic using memory words (`%MW0`, `%MW2`, `%MW4`)
  - Level sensor input logic (`%I125.x`)
  - Pump and solenoid output control (`%Q124.x`)
  - Timer-based maintenance logic using `TON`
